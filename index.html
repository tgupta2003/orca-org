			<p class="our-st">PLAN TO PROTECT</p> 
			<p class="our-st2">Orcas, found in all oceans and most seas in the world, are vital in keeping regions’ ecosystems intact. They play a significant role in keeping marine-life population balanced and dispersing nutrients in oceans and seas. These intelligent, quick, social creatures have unfortunately been taken into captivity since 1961 — disrupting their natural social groupings. Since then, they’ve been used for commercial and research purposes, with over 176 dying in captivity. Orcas in the waters surrounding British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, are now regarded as an endangered population — with numbers dropping each year. 

			<br>
			<br>

			Join us in supporting the release of orcas in captivity back into the wild where they deserve
			a chance to live, grow, prosper in their rightful habitats.

		<!-- <p class="our-st">OUR STORY</p> -->
		<!-- Taken from: https://weare.lush.com/lush-life/our-company/who-we-are/ -->
		<!-- <p class="our-st2"> Lush was founded in 1995 by six co-founders; Mo Constantine, Mark Constantine, Rowena Bird, Helen Ambrosen, Liz Bennett and Paul Greeves.

		Emerging from the demise of a previous mail order business called Cosmetics To Go – a massive success that collapsed through a combination of over-trading and flooding – it was the same team that created and inspired this new venture called Lush.

		Lush is 10% Employee Owned and our people are the heart and soul of our business…</p>
